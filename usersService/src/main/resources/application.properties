#this will assign a random port to the application
#we do not care what port number is assigned because if have 100 instances of this app, it will become difficult to track
#this is why we register the application instance with eureka, so that it will handle this for us
# it also means that if we have 100 instances, for each instance, you would need to g to the app.properties file and change the port number
# HELL NO WE ARE NOT DOING THAT
# also note, that by using ${PORT:0} we are saying that we can accept a command line argument. and if it is not passed in, then give it
# a random port number.

eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone = http://localhost:8010/eureka

# this is the eureka instance Id
# the applciation name is read from above in this file.
# similarly here, we can give instance_id passed in as a command line arg, or it will be assigned as a random value.
